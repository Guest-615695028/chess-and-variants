# Chess & Variants, written in C/C++
Chess is a two-player board game, whose current form emerged in Southern Europe during the late 15th century after evolving from the ancient Indian game, Chaturanga.
Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.

Chess is an abstract strategy game with no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard of eight-by-eight grid.
At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
The game object is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw:
1. Stalemate: the player to move has no legal move, but is not in check;
2. Threefold repetition;
3. Dead position: no player can force a checkmate to the other;
4. 50-move rule: no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made during the previous 50 moves, the game results in draw.
5. Draw by agreement;
